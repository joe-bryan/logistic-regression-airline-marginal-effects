# The marginal effects on airline passenger satisfaction
This project is inspired from the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teejmahal20/airline-passenger-satisfaction">Kaggle dataset</a> on Airline Passenger Satisfaction.

## Context
This dataset contains an airline passenger survey. 23 questions were asked to each respondent. 129,880 observations were recorded.

## Goal
The task is to measure the marginal effects of each feature on satisfaction. Does the feature positively or negatively impact satisfaction, and how much? 
to determine which promotion should be used by the fast food chain.

## Questions
<ol>
<li>View correlations of features with satisfaction</li>
<li>Use p-value to check for statistical significance</li>
<li>Analyze the sign of the features in the logistic regression model</li>
<li>Analyze the marginal effects of each feature</li>
<li>Test other logistic regression models with different amounts of features</li>
</ol>
